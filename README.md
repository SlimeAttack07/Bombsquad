# Bombsquad
A crazy bomber has invaded Teardown! Join the bombsquad, locate the bombs and dismantle them before they detonate!!

Currently features 102 unique bomb designs, 4 bomb sizes, 7 defusal minigames, and 6 supported maps.
Note: More maps will be added over time. They take a lot of time to set up so please be patient. Read the 'Supported Maps' discussion to see all supported maps.

How to use this mod:
The mod features a dual mode type control: Use 'P' to cycle the main mode and use 'O' to cycle the sub-mode. For some options, you may use 'L' to change the value passed to the sub-option.
You can hold shift to cycle in the opposite direction (but not for the value key 'L').
The modes are listed further down.
The simplest way to play is as follows:
1. Load a supported map. All supported maps can be found in this discussion: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2805521710/3273564671169080683/
2. Use main mode 'Game' and sub-mode 'Help' to read the help, which also contains these instructions.
3. Use sub-mode 'Config' to change any settings you want. When you're satisfied, click 'Load Tags'.
4. Assuming you chose a supported map, a popup on top should inform you that the tags were setup correctly.
	If you're planning on playing multiple rounds on this map, then you should quick save now. After a round ends, you should quick load first.
5. Using main mode 'Spawn Bombs' and the four submodes, spawn as many bombs as you want. It is recommended you spawn between 3 to 12 bombs, starting with the small bombs and ending with mega bombs.
	The first bomb you spawn has the shortest timer, the last bomb you spawn has the longest timer.
6. Using main mode 'Game' and sub-mode 'Start', click to start the game.
7. Using the main mode 'Dismantle', use the 'Scan' and 'Analyze' sub-modes to locate bombs. Use the 'Cutters' sub-mode to dismantle bombs.
8. (OPTIONAL) For the best experience, play like a normal, decent human being. Don't use fly mods and only break things to access bombs. It is also recommended you use the following mods to enhance gameplay:
	- Explosive Vehicles (You should set the 'Strength' in it's config to at most 75 to prevent vehicles exploding when you break a small piece to access a bomb inside it.)
	- Fire Fighter (If you're playing with 'Fire Bombs' on then you'll want something better than the fire extinguisher to prevent massive fires from igniting/detonating other bombs..)
	- No Fire Limit (If you really want to make things chaotic..)

If you want to play on maps that are currently not supported, then read the 'Playing on unsupported maps' discussion.
If you want help me implement maps faster, then read the 'Helping me implement maps' discussion.

NOTE: Performance mods may cause small bombs to be deleted or may cause some bombs to become unable to spawn at all. Use at your own risk.
This mod has its own customized performance mod that doesn't delete bombs like other performance mods will. It is enabled by default, but can be disabled in the in-game config mode.

Current config options can be found in the 'Config Options' discussion:

Bomb Sizes:
- Small bombs: Don't do a lot of damage, but spawn a condensed amount of fire nearby. Often hidden in sneaky places.

- Medium bombs: Deal a bit more damage then small bombs, and spawn a large quantity of fire around them. Since these fires can end up detonating other bombs, these bombs are a high priority!

- Large bombs: These deal a lot of damage, but don't spawn that much fire. Often placed near key places such as walkways, elevators, etc.

- Mega bombs: Capable of obliterating entire rooms or small structures, these bombs deal a massive amount of damage but spawn barely any fire at all (mostly since there'll be nothing left to burn..).
WARNING: These bombs are very laggy!! There is a setting available in the in-game 'Config' mode called 'Clear Lag' that can help dealing with this. It is enabled by default.
